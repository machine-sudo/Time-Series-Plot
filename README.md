# Time-Series-Plot
In this project, I plotted the time series of IP (industrial production from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, monthly data). I plotted the ACF and PACF of IP and tested the stationary of the IP (use 5% significant level) over one time lag. Plotted the time series of differenced IP, ACF and PACF of the differenced IP. Test the stationary of the differenced IP to find seasonal pattern and trend pattern in the series of IP. Used AIC or BIC to identify an optimal ARIMA model for the time series. Used Ljung-Box test to evaluate the serial correlation of residuals.
